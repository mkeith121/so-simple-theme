***Welcome to my blog!*** 

As a quick introduction, and as you may have guessed, I'm Mark. I presently live in [Scranton, PA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunder_Mifflin) with my wife, Caitlin. 

We moved here in August of last year, and for the past 5 or so months, I've been working as a barista at [Zummo's Cafe](https://www.facebook.com/zummoscafe/).

I read and wrote my first lines of JavaScript in October of last year. I'm hooked. Ever since working at a startup-stage company in San Francisco, I've been increasingly more excited to start building great products. My path to programming prowess (not close yet) took me through several resources and finally, as of February, 29 2016, I'm enrolled in and attending [***Hack Reactor Remote Beta***](http://www.hackreactor.com/remote-beta) as a member of the 14th cohort. 

I'm hoping this blog serves as my grounding amidst the chaos and my sounding block for anyone with time to read it--- it'll be my personal journal, and a way of staying in touch with friends and family who are having trouble reaching me. (sorry in advance!)

Thanks for stopping by!
